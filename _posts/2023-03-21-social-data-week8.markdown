So I don't have a lot to say, this is mostly to make sure that things work. 

I can now use latex for simple inline variables like $$\sigma^2$$. But that's not all, I can also do displaymath

$$e^{i\pi} + 1= 0.$$

Pretty nice, right!? 

I'm also including a simple image from a previous lecture

I like the inclusion of math so much that I need to also see what a simple integral looks like

\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+1} \mathrm{d}x =\frac{\pi}{2}
\end{equation}
